# Brute Force Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains a Java implementation of a brute-force algorithm designed to find combinations of numbers that sum up to a given target. It iterates through all possible combinations of numbers within a specified range to identify those that meet the target sum criteria.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Search**: Iterates through every possible combination of numbers within a specified range to ensure no potential solution is missed.
- **Customizable Range and Target**: Allows users to define the range of numbers and the target sum to cater to different scenarios and needs.
- **Efficiency Measures**: Although brute force is inherently comprehensive, the implementation includes optimizations to reduce unnecessary computations.
- **Simple and Intuitive**: Easy-to-understand Java code that can be modified and extended according to user requirements.

## Project Setup

To run the algorithm, you'll need Java installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/brute-force-algorithm.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code:
   ```bash
   cd brute-force-algorithm
   ```
3. Compile the Java code:
   ```bash
   javac BruteForce.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java BruteForce
   ```

Modify the `maxHashes` and `maxSum` variables in the `BruteForce.java` file to adjust the range of numbers and the target sum according to your requirements. Then compile and run the program as described in the "Project Setup" section.
