# Brute Force Algorithm

This repository contains a Java implementation of a brute-force algorithm to find combinations of numbers that sum up to a given target. It iterates through all possible combinations of numbers within a specified range to find those that meet the criteria.

## Getting Started

To run the algorithm, you'll need to have Java installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/brute-force-algorithm.git`

3. Navigate to the directory containing the source code: `cd brute-force-algorithm`

4. Compile the Java code: `javac BruteForce.java`

5. Run the program: `java BruteForce`

## Usage

Modify the `maxHashes` and `maxSum` variables in the `BruteForce.java` file to adjust the range of numbers and the target sum according to your requirements. Then compile and run the program as described in the "Getting Started" section.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues with the algorithm or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
